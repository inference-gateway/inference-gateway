# Custom Instructions for Claude

Today is June 9, 2025.

- Always use context7 to check for the latest updates, features, or best practices of a library relevant to the task at hand.
- Always prefer Table-Driven Testing: When writing tests.
- Always use Early Returns: Favor early returns to simplify logic and avoid deep nesting with if-else structures.
- Always prefer switch statements over if-else chains: Use switch statements for cleaner and more readable code when checking multiple conditions.
- Always run `task lint` before committing code to ensure it adheres to the project's linting rules.
- When working on MCP (Model Context Protocol) related tasks, always refer to the official MCP documentation and examples for guidance and ensure you run `task mcp-schema-download` and `task generate` to keep the MCP Golang types up to date.
- Always run `task build` to verify compilation after making changes.
- Always run `task test` before committing code to ensure all tests pass.
- Always search for the simplest solution first before considering more complex alternatives.
- Always prefer type safety over dynamic typing: Use strong typing and interfaces to ensure type safety and reduce runtime errors.
- Always use lowercase log messages for consistency and readability.
- When possible code to an interface so it's easier to mock in tests.
- When writing tests, each test case should have it's own isolated mock server mock dependecies so it's easier to understand and maintain.

## Development Workflow

1. Run `task mcp-schema-download` to download the latest MCP schema - when working on MCP.
2. Run `task a2a-schema-download` to download the latest A2A schema - when working on A2A.
3. Update `openapi.yaml` with the new configuration fields in the appropriate section.
4. Run `task generate` If added new Schemas to openapi.yaml, update internal/openapi/schemas.go to include the new schemas.
5. Run `task lint` to ensure code quality.
6. Run `task build` to verify successful compilation.
7. Run `task test` to ensure all tests pass.
